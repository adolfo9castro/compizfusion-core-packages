Suggests: compizconfig-settings-manager
Description: OpenGL window and compositing manager (metapackage)
 Compiz brings to life a variety of visual effects that make the Linux desktop
 easier to use, more powerful and intuitive, and more accessible for users
 with special needs.
 .
 This metapackage provides the components necessary for running compiz. It
 provides the compiz core, a set of standard plugins, a window decorator using
 the Gtk toolkit and the files necessary to integrate compiz with the MATE
 desktop environment.

Description: OpenGL window and compositing manager
 Compiz brings to life a variety of visual effects that make the Linux desktop
 easier to use, more powerful and intuitive, and more accessible for users
 with special needs.
 .
 Compiz combines together a window manager and a composite manager using
 OpenGL for rendering. A "window manager" allows the manipulation of the
 multiple applications and dialog windows that are presented on the screen. A
 "composite manager" allows windows and other graphics to be combined together
 to create composite images. Compiz achieves its stunning effects by doing
 both of these functions.

Package: compiz-locales
Architecture: all
Depends: compiz-core, locales, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Translations for the Compiz OpenGL window/compositing manager
 This package contains translations for the Compiz OpenGL window and 
 compositing manager, needed when you want to be able to select an interface 
 language other than English (GB/US) or French.

Description: OpenGL window and compositing manager - MATE window decorator
 Compiz brings to life a variety of visual effects that make the Linux desktop
 easier to use, more powerful and intuitive, and more accessible for users
 with special needs.
 .
 This package contains a window decorator that uses Gtk to provide a look and
 feel similar to that of the marco window manager, and files needed to 
 integrate compiz with the MATE desktop environment.

Package: compiz-plugins
